# Questions

We use Slack for Arkime questions and save GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
You may find that we close questions on GitHub with just a link to this document, sorry about that, but it keeps us better organized.

The [FAQ](https://arkime.com/faq) is a great place to start if you have a question, especially the [Arkime is not working](https://arkime.com/faq#arkime-is-not-working) answer.

Please join the Arkime Slack [here](https://slackinvite.arkime.com). If you already have joined, you can find the web interface [here](https://arkime.slack.com) (although we recommend using one of the desktop clients).

# Reporting Security Issues

The Arkime project takes security very seriously, but any complex software project is going to have some vulnerabilities.
Please submit any security issues to [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/verizonmedia) or [arkime.security@verizonmedia.com](mailto: arkime.security@verizonmedia.com), please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/arkime/arkime/issues) or Slack for non security issues.
