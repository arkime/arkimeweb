# Questions

We use Slack for helping folks with questions about Arkime, and save Github issues for bug reports and feature requests.
You may find that we close questions on github with just a link to this document, sorry about that, but it keeps us better organized.
Please join the Arkime Slack [here](https://slackinvite.arkime.com) or if you already have joined you can find the web interface [here](https://arkime.slack.com), although we recommend using one of the desktop clients.
The [FAQ](https://arkime.com/faq) is a great place to start if you have a question, especially the [Arkime is not working](https://arkime.com/faq#arkime-is-not-working) answer.


# Reporting Security Issues

The Arkime project takes security very seriously, but any complex software project is going to have some vulnerabilities.
Please submit any security issues to [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/verizonmedia) or arkime.security@verizonmedia.com, please use [github issues](https://github.com/arkime/arkime/issues) or slack for non security issues.
