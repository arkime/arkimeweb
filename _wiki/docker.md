# Docker
{: .section-header.mt-1 }

Great news for containerized deployments!
Starting with version 5.5.0 Arkime offers official images for a simplified setup.
We've adopted a user-friendly approach: a single image handles all Arkime tools, with specific commands determining which tool launches.

We provide a docker.sh script (optional) to initiate different tools using the image.
However you don't have to use it, you can run the tools directly from the container.
This gives you control over how you interact with Arkime within your container environment.

To see the options that docker.sh supports use `docker run ghcr.io/arkime/arkime/arkime:v5-latest /opt/arkime/bin/docker.sh help`

## Choosing the Right Arkime Image Tag
{: .subsection }

We offer several tags to help you choose the right Arkime image for your needs.
All of our releases are multi architecture, so you can use the same tag on both amd64 and arm64 systems.
We recommend using the v5-latest tag or v5.6.1 (or later) for the most stable experience.

### Stable Releases:

* v5-latest: This tag points to the most recent stable release within the 5.x series. Use this if you want to stay on a specific major version. (recommended)
* v5-ja4-latest: Same as v5-latest but with the [ja4 plugin](https://arkime.com/ja4) included.
* latest: This tag points to the most recent stable release.
* ja4-latest: Same as latest but with the [ja4 plugin](https://arkime.com/ja4) included.
* v5.M.B: This tag points to a specific release version (e.g., v5.5.0). Use this if you need a particular version for compatibility or other reasons.
* v5.M.B-ja4: Same as v5.M.B but with the [ja4 plugin](https://arkime.com/ja4) included.

### Development Snapshots:

* snapshot-v5-latest: This tag points to the latest development snapshot, which is built after each commit. Use this if you're testing the latest features or bug fixes, if you're contributing to the Arkime project, or you like the thrill of living on the edge. This should be stable enough for most users, but it's not recommended for production use.
* snapshot-v5-ja4-latest: Same as snapshot-v5-latest but with the [ja4 plugin](https://arkime.com/ja4) included.
* snapshot-v6-latest: This tag points to the latest development snapshot for the upcoming 6.x release. Currently not recommended for anyone.
* snapshot-v6-ja4-latest: Same as snapshot-v6-latest but with the [ja4 plugin](https://arkime.com/ja4) included.

## Configuring Arkime Containers
{: .subsection }

You can configure Arkime containers using three primary methods:

1. Environment Variables:
* Set environment variables to configure the container. (`ARKIME>__<config>=<value>` for default section or `ARKIME_<section>__<config>=<value>`)
* These variables take precedence over configuration file settings.
2. Configuration File:
* Create a local configuration file.
* Mount this file into the container to override default settings.
* Some complex config file sections may require this method.
3. Command-Line Options:
* Use the `-o` command-line option to specify additional configuration options. (`-o <section>.<config>=<value>`)
* This method provides flexibility for one-time or specific configuration changes, but not recommended.

For comprehensive configuration, consider combining these methods:
* Base Configuration: Use a configuration file for general settings.
* Overrides: Employ environment variables for specific overrides.

By strategically combining these methods, you can effectively tailor Arkime containers to your specific requirements.

## Setting up an Arkime environment
{: .subsection }

1. Install OpenSearch or Elasticsearch
* You can use either containerized or a standalone installation.
2. Initialize OpenSearch or Elasticsearch for Arkime
* `docker run ghcr.io/arkime/arkime/arkime:v5-latest /opt/arkime/db/db.pl --insecure https://ESHOST:9200 init`
* This is a one time operation to create the Arkime indices in OpenSearch/Elasticsearch.
* Use the special hostname `host.docker.internal` for ESHOST if OpenSearch/Elasticsearch is running on the same host.
* You may need to specify a network mode for docker, such as `--network=host`.
3. Setup directories
* You'll need directories for your pcap and optionally configuration files to be mounted into the container.
* The examples use `/opt/arkime/raw` and `/opt/arkime/etc`
* We don't recommend using /home based directories since you may run into permission issues.
4. Create configuration files - You can use the default configuration or create your own at `/opt/arkime/etc/config.ini` see [Arkime Settings](/settings).
5. Start your Arkime containers.

## Common issues
{: .subsection }

### Can't view PCAP files

The capture and viewer must use the same node name when on the same physical host.
When using different containers for capture and viewer, you may need to add a `-n <nodename>` to both the capture and viewer commands.


## Sample Capture/Viewer Config File
{: .subsection }
The Arkime defaults are usually good enough to get started.  The examples save this file as `/opt/arkime/etc/config.ini` and mount the `/opt/arkime/etc` directory into the container.

```
[default]
### DB Settings - https://arkime.com/settings#db
elasticsearch=***UPDATE***

### PCAP Reading - https://arkime.com/settings#reader-afpacket
interface=***UPDATE***
snapLen=32768
pcapReadMethod=afpacketv3
tpacketv3NumThreads=1

### PCAP Writing - https://arkime.com/settings#pcapstorage
pcapDir=/opt/arkime/raw

### Processing - https://arkime.com/settings#capture
packetThreads=1
rirFile=/opt/arkime/etc/ipv4-address-space.csv
ouiFile=/opt/arkime/etc/oui.txt
#rulesFiles=/opt/arkime/etc/default.rules

### User/Group to drop privileges to, pcapDir must be writable by this user or group
dropUser=nobody
dropGroup=daemon
```

## Docker Compose Examples
{: .subsection }

### Cont3xt
{: .subsubsection }

In this example we are starting cont3xt and using a local cont3xt.ini file and overriding the port cont3xt listens on.
Environment variables are of the format `ARKIME_<section>__<config>=<value>`.

```
version: '3'

services:
  cont3xt:
    image: ghcr.io/arkime/arkime/arkime:v5-latest
    network_mode: "host"
    command: /opt/arkime/bin/docker.sh cont3xt
    environment:
      - ARKIME_cont3xt__port=3220
    volumes:
      - ./cont3xt.ini:/opt/arkime/etc/cont3xt.ini
    restart: always
```

### Capture and Viewer

For capture and viewer you'll need to mount a directory for the pcap data and we recommend mounting a etc directory for the configuration and all the extra GEO files. Make sure the directories are writable by the container.

```
version: '3'

services:
  capture:
    image: ghcr.io/arkime/arkime/arkime:v5-latest
    network_mode: "host"
    command: /opt/arkime/bin/docker.sh capture --update-geo
    environment:
      - ARKIME__elasticsearch=https://example.com:9200
    volumes:
      - /opt/arkime/raw:/opt/arkime/raw
      - /opt/arkime/etc:/opt/arkime/etc
    restart: always
  viewer:
    image: ghcr.io/arkime/arkime/arkime:v5-latest
    network_mode: "host"
    command: /opt/arkime/bin/docker.sh viewer
    environment:
      - ARKIME__elasticsearch=https://example.com:9200
    volumes:
      - /opt/arkime/raw:/opt/arkime/raw
      - /opt/arkime/etc:/opt/arkime/etc
    restart: always
```
