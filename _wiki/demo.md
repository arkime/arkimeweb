We've set up instances of the various tools in the Arkime system to give you a chance to play with demo data.
These are live systems with public data, so remember to be respectful of others and not to upload any sensitive information.
If you have any questions or need help, please join us on [Slack](https://slackinvite.arkime.com/).

We are providing demo instances of the main branch of both Arkime 5 and Arkime 6.
Arkime 6 is currently in development and is not feature complete, but will be getting some UI updates!
