              Arkimeet Us: Renaming Moloch!
            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p class="lead text-justify mt-4">
              Moloch has experienced significant growth and change over the last
              eight years of development. We have grown from an obscure network
              capturing tool developed at AOL to an open source project with over
              4.4k GitHub stars and a dedicated open source community. Countless
              and often nameless organizations use Moloch to secure their networks
              at a fraction of the cost of comparable proprietary software. We
              never could have envisioned such growth and community -- and we
              couldn’t be more thankful for all of you!
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">
              We’ve reached the next stage of the project’s journey and we made
              the difficult decision to change our name. We heard clear concerns
              from the community that the name “Moloch” might send unintended or
              undesirable signals to those who use or might want to adopt it. In
              changing our name, we seek to alleviate those concerns -- make the
              project approachable and to foster an inclusive and positive
              community.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">
              In addition to the rename, we will move Arkime out of the AOL
              GitHub organization into its own organization. There, we will
              release version 3.0 early next year - more updates to follow.
              We've also taken this opportunity to update and simplify our owl
              logo to something that will look and function better across all
              types of media.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">
              Coming up with a new name is not easy. We spent months coming up
              with a plethora of names. Some silly and quirky, like Pacul8r,
              Owluminate, Meowlz, and Packet Pocket. And some completely wrong
              like Pakapture, Lightrace, and Eventercept. We aren’t the most
              adept at coming up creative names, we are software developers, after
              all. But in the end, there was one name that we kept coming back
              to: <strong class="dark-primary-theme-text text-thick">Arkime!</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">
              Why Arkime (/ɑːrkɪˈmi/)? In our journey to find a new name, we
              wanted to convey the software’s ability to capture and store
              immense amounts of network traffic as well as our sarcastic and
              sometimes grouchy approach to software development. And we knew we
              had to keep the owl!
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-justify">
              Owls inspire us, and one of our favorite owls is Archimedes,
              Merlin’s smart, grouchy, and sarcastic buddy. This resonated with
              us. Also, the mathematician, engineer, and inventor, Archimedes,
              created the system of using exponentiation for expressing very
              large numbers.  And thus, Arkime was chosen!
            </p>
