        Upgrading Arkime requires you install versions in order, as
        described in the chart below. If the version you are currently
        on isn’t listed please upgrade to the next higher version in the
        chart, you can then install the major releases in order to catch up.
        New installs can start from the latest version.

          You can add multiple <code>--debug</code> options to get even more information.
          Capture will print out the config settings it is using, verify they

          To delete all the SPI data stored in Elasticsearch, use the

          commands is that <code>wipe</code> leaves the

      <p>
        It is possible to get self signed certificates to work in the following scenarios:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          User to Arkime Viewer
        </li>
        <li>
          Viewer to Elasticsearch
        </li>
        <li>
          Capture to Elasticsearch
        </li>
        <li>
          MultiES to Elasticsearch
        </li>
        <li>
          Viewer to MultiES
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Usually the easiest way is to add the self signed cert to the OS's list
        of valid certificates or chains.  Googling is the best way to figure out
        how to do this.  Viewer also supports a <a href="/settings#catrustfile"><code>caTrustFile</code></a> option.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core Arkime team does not support or recommend self signed certs.
        Use the money you are saving on a commercial product and go buy real
        certs. Wildcard certs are now cheap and you can even go with free
        Lets Encrypt certs. There may be folks on the Arkime slack workspace
        willing to help out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both capture and viewer can run with <code>--insecure</code> to turn off
        cert checking.  You will need to add this option to the startup command for
        both capture and viewer.
        For example change in the <code>/etc/systemd/system/arkimecapture.conf</code> file, the <code>ExecStart</code>
        line from <code>... capture -c ...</code> to <code>... capture --insecure -c ...</code>.

        Moloch 1.0 has some large changes and updates that will require all
        session data to be reindexed. The reindexing is done in the background
        AFTER upgrading so there is little downtime. Large changes in 1.0 include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All the field names have been renamed, and analyzed fields have been

        <li>
          Country codes are being changed from 3 character to 2 character

        <li>
          Tags will NOT be migrated if added before 0.14.1

        If you have any special parsers, tagger, plugins or wise source you may
        have to change configurations.

      <ul>
        <li>
          All db fields will need -term removed, capture won’t start and will
          warn you
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To upgrade:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First make sure you are using ES 5.5.x (5.6 recommended) and Moloch
          0.20.2 or 0.50.x before continuing. Upgrade to those version first!
        </li>
        <li>
          Download 1.1.1 from the
          <a href="downloads">
            downloads page
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Shutdown all capture, viewer and wise processes
        </li>
        <li>
          Install Moloch 1.1.1
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <code>/data/moloch/bin/moloch_update_geo.sh</code> on all capture
          nodes which will download the new mmdb style maxmind files
        </li>
        <li>
          Run <code>db.pl http://ESHOST:9200 upgrade</code> once
        </li>
        <li>
          Start wise, then capture, then viewers.
          Especially watch the capture.log file for any warnings/errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verify that NEW data is being collected and showing up in viewer,
          all old data will NOT show up yet.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once 1.1.1 is working, its time to reindex the old session data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Disable any db.pl expire or optimize jobs, or curator
        </li>
        <li>
          Start screen or tmux since this will take several days
        </li>
        <li>
          In the <code>/data/moloch/viewer</code> directory, run
          <code>/data/moloch/viewer/reindex2.js --slices X</code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The number of slices should be between 2 and the number of shards
              each index has, the higher the faster but more Elasticsearch CPU
              that will be used. We recommend 1/2 the number of shards.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can optionally add a --index option if there are indices you
              need to reindex first, otherwise it will work from newest to oldest
            </li>
            <li>
              You can optionally add a --deleteOnDone, which will delete indices
              as they are converted, but you may want to try a reindex first on 1
              index to make sure it is working.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          As reindex runs old data will show up in viewer
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete ALL old indices with
          <pre><code>curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/sessions-*'</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the reindex finishes run the db.pl expire/optimize or curator job
          manually, this will take a while
        </li>
        <li>
          Now can reenable any db.pl expire or optimize jobs, or curator.
          <strong>
            Do NOT reenable crons until you let them run and finish manually.
          </strong>

      <p>
        Upgrading to Moloch 2.0 is a multistep process that requires an outage.
        An outage is required because all the captures must be stopped before upgrading the database so there are no schema issues or corruption.
        Most of the administrative indices will have new version numbers after this upgrade, so that elasticsearch knows they were created with 6.7 or 6.8.

      <p>
        <strong>3.0 has not been released yet, this are preliminary instructions!</strong>
        Upgrading to Arkime 3.0 is a multistep process that requires an outage.
        An outage is required because all the captures must be stopped before upgrading the database so there are no schema issues or corruption.
        Most of the administrative indices will have new version numbers after this upgrade, so that elasticsearch knows they were created with 7.
        This is very important when upgrading to ES 8.x later.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be using Moloch 2.5 (Moloch 2.7.1 recommended) BEFORE trying to upgrade to Arkime 3.0</li>
        <li>You must be using Elasticsearch 7.4+ (Elasticsearch <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch">7.9.3</a> or later recommended) BEFORE trying to upgrade to Arkime 3.0</li>

        Some important things to remember when designing your cluster:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SPI data is usually kept longer then PCAP data. For example, you may
          store PCAP for a week but SPI data for a month.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have at least 1% of disk space used by ES available in ES heap memory.
          For example, if the cluster has 7TB of data then 7*0.01 or 70GB of ES heap memory is the minimum recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assign half the memory to Elasticsearch (but no more then 30G per node, read
          <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/a-heap-of-trouble"
            rel="nofollow">
            https://www.elastic.co/blog/a-heap-of-trouble</a>)
          and half the memory to disk cache.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use version 7 of Elasticsearch or later.
        </li>
        <li>
          A quick disk requirement estimate is 5% of the PCAP storage, if storing for the same amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have large machines, they you can run multiple nodes per MACHINE, although this complicates deployments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We have some <a href="estimators"> estimators </a> that may help.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is that it is easy to add new nodes in the future, so feel free to start with less nodes.
        As a temporary fix to capacity problems, you can reduce the number of days of meta data that are stored.
        You can use the Arkime ES Indices tab to delete the oldest <code>sessions2</code> index.

      <p>
        The SPI data in Elasticsearch and the PCAP data are not deleted at the same time.
        The PCAP data is deleted as the disk fills up on the capture machines, <a href="#pcap-deletion">more info</a>.
        PCAP deletion happens automatically and nothing needs to be done.
        The SPI data is either deleted by using <a href="#ilm">ILM</a> or when the <code>./db.pl expire</code> command is run, usually from cron during off peak.
        Unless you use <a href="#ilm">ILM</a>, the SPI data deletion does NOT happen automatically and a cron job MUST be set up.
        A sample cron setup might look like this to only keep 90 days and expire at midnight:
        <pre> 0 0 * * * /data/moloch/db/db.pl http://localhost:9200 expire daily 90</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        So deleting a PCAP file will NOT delete the SPI data, and deleting the
        SPI data will not delete the PCAP data from disk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UI does have commands to delete and scrub individual sessions, but
        the user must have the <code>Remove Data</code> ability on the users tab.
        This feature is used for things you don’t want operators to see, such as bad images,
        and not a general solution to freeing disk space.

      <p>
        This error almost always means that your Elasticsearch cluster can not
        keep up with the amount of sessions that the capture nodes are trying to
        send it. You may only see the error message on your busiest capture nodes
        since capture tries to buffer the requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things to check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Since Moloch 1.7.0 the ES Nodes tab of the Stats section now has the
          ability to turn on Write Task completed and rejected columns. Look for
          nodes having issues. Make sure those nodes don’t have disk issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure each Elasticsearch node has 30G of memory (no more) and 30G
          of disk cache (at least) available to it. So for example if you are on
          a 64G machine only run 1 Elasticsearch node on the machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure swap is turned off or swappiness is 0 on Elasticsearch machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are running multiple Elasticsearch nodes make sure the disks can
          support the iops load. It is usually best to have each ES use its own disk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you are running the latest Elasticsearch that the version of
          Moloch supports, for example 7.9.3 if using Elasticsearch 7.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using replication on the sessions index, turn off replication of the
          current day and only replicate past days. This can be done by using
          <code>--replicas 1</code>
          with your daily
          <code>./db.pl expire</code>
          run after turning off replicate in the sessions template using
          <code>./db.pl upgrade</code>
          without the
          <code>--replicas</code>
          option
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure there is at most 1 shard of each sessions per node, if there
          are more run
          <code>./db.pl upgrade</code>
          again
        </li>
        <li>
          You can increase the size of the write task Q in Elasticsearch, see
          <a href="#recommended-elasticsearch-settings">
            Recommended Elasticsearch Settings</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If these don’t help, you need to add more nodes or reduce the number of
        sessions being monitored. You can reduce the number of sessions with
        <a href="settings#packet-drop-ips">
          packet-drop-ips</a>
        or bpf filters or
        <a href="rulesformat">
          rules files</a>
        for example.

      <p>
        If queries are too slow the easiest fix is to add additional
        Elasticsearch nodes. Elasticsearch doesn’t do well if Java hits an
        OutOfMemory condition. If you ever have one, you should immediately
        delete the oldest
        <code>sessions2-*</code>
        index, update the
        <code>daily.sh</code>
        script to delete more often, and restart the Elasticsearch cluster.
        Then you should order more machines. :)

      <ul>
        <li>
          Go into the Arkime stats page and the ES Shards subtab
        </li>
        <li>
          Click on the nodes you want to remove and exclude them
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait for the shards to be moved off
        </li>
        <li>
          If no shards move, you may need to config Elasticsearch to allow 2
          shards per node, although a large number may be required if removing
          many nodes.
          <pre><code>curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/sessions*/_settings' -d '{
  "index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node": 2
}'</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are many shards that need to be redistributed, the defaults
          might take days, which is good for the cluster, but it might make you
          crazy. Increase the speed from default 3 streams at 20mb (60mb/sec) to
          something higher like 6 streams at 50mb (300mb/sec). Obviously, adjust
          for the speed of the new nodes' disks and network.
          <pre><code>curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{"transient":{
  "indices.recovery.concurrent_streams":6,
  "indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec":"50mb"}

      <p>
        Turning on replication will consume twice the disk space on the nodes
        and increase the network bandwidth between nodes, so make sure you
        actually <strong>need</strong> replication.
      </p>
      <p>
        To change future days
        <pre><code>db/db.pl &lt;ESHOST:ESPORT&gt; upgrade --replicas 1</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        To change past days, but not the current day
        <pre><code>db/db.pl &lt;ESHOST:ESPORT&gt; expire &lt;type&gt; &lt;num&gt; --replicas 1</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend the second solution since it allows current traffic to be
        written to ES once, and during off peak the previous days traffic will
        be replicated.

        Here are some of our recommended Elasticsearch settings. Many of these
        can be updated on the fly, but it is still best to put them in your
        <code>elasticsearch.yml</code> file. We strongly recommend using the same
        <code>elasticsearch.yml</code> file on all hosts, things that need to be
        different per host can be set with variables.

          You will probably want to change the watermark settings so you can use

          ALL values, but you can’t mix them. The most common sign of a problem
          with these settings is an error that has
          <code>FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete</code> in it. You can
          use
          <code> ./db.pl http://ESHOST:9200 unflood-stage _all </code>
          to clear the error, once you adjust the settings and/or delete some
          data.

        Using ILM with Arkime

          onclick="copyLink(this, 'faq')">

      </h3>
      <p>
        Since Moloch 2.2 you can easily use ILM to handle moving indices from hot to warm, force merge, and delete actions.
        We recommend only using ILM with newer versions (7.2+) of Elasticsearch, since older versions did have some issues.
        Once ILM is enabled you no longer have to use the <code>db.pl expire</code> cron job, but should occasionally run <code>db.pl optimize-admin</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ILM is only included in the free "basic" Elasticsearch license, so it is not part of the Elasticsearch OSS distribution, so you may need to upgrade.
        Arkime does NOT currently support the auto rollover feature of ILM for performance reasons when searching.
      </p>
      <p>
        These instructions assume you are using db.pl or Arkime UI to setup ILM and will use a special <code>molochtype</code> attribute name.
        You can also do this with Kibana to create the ILM config, and not use the <code>molochtype</code> attribute name, however then you will need to do everything on your own.
        There are five important steps to have ILM work correctly with Arkime.
        <ol>
          <li>If you are using hot/warm design, or might in the future, for each elasticsearch node add to your elaticsearch.yml a line with <code>node.attr.molochtype: warm</code> or <code>node.attr.molochtype: hot</code></li>
          <li>Create the molochsessions and molochhistory ILM polices.  This can be done easily with kibana or we recommend <code>db.pl ilm</code> command.</li>
          <li>Assign the molochsessions and molochhistory ILM polices to all the existing indices.  Kibana or <code>db.pl ilm</code> can perform this action.</li>
          <li>Change the moloch templates to use the ILM polices for NEW indices.  You'll need to rerun <code>db.pl upgrade ... --ilm</code> and add the <code>--ilm</code> to the command. Also add <code>--hotwarm</code> if using a hot/warm design.</li>
          <li>Replace the previous <code>db.pl expire</code> cron job with <code>db.pl optimize-admin</code></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        So for example to create new policies that keeps 30 weeks of history, 90 days of SPI data, with 1 replica, and optimizes all indices older than 25 hours you would run:
        <code>./db.pl http://localhost:9200 ilm 25h 90d --history 30 --replicas 1</code>
        You would then need to run upgrade with all the arguments you usually used plus --ilm:
        <code>./db.pl http://localhost:9200 upgrade --replicas 1 --shards 5 --ilm</code>

      <p>
        The goal of Arkime is to use commodity hardware. If you start thinking
        about using SSDs or expensive NICs, research if it would just be cheaper
        to buy one more box. This gains more retention and can bring the cost of
        each machine down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things to remember when selecting a machine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An average of 1Gbps of network traffic requires 11TB of disk a day.
          For example to store 7 days of 2.5Gbps average traffic you need
          7*2.5*11 or 192.5TB of disk space.
        </li>
        <li>
          The total bandwidth number must include both RX and TX bandwidth.
          For example a 10G link can really produce up to 20G of traffic to
          capture, 10G in each direction. Include both directions in your
          calculations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t overload network links to capture. Monitoring a 10G link with an
          average of 4Gbps RX AND 4Gbps TX should use two 10G
          <code>moloch-capture</code> links, since 8Gbps is close to the max.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arkime requires all packets from the same 5-tuple to be processed by
          the same <code>moloch-capture</code> process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When selecting Arkime capture boxes, standard "Big Data" boxes might be
        the best bet. ($10k-$25k each) Look for:
      <ul>
        <li>
          CASE: There are many 4RU boxes out there. If space is an issue, there
          are more expensive 2RU boxes that hold over 20 drives (examples

          MEMORY: 64GB to 96GB (or more if running other tools)
        </li>
        <li>
          OS DISKS: We like RAID 1 small drives. SSDs are nice but not required.
        </li>
        <li>
          CAPTURE DISKS: 20+ x 4TB or larger SATA drives. Don’t waste money on
          enterprise/SAS/15k drives.
        </li>
        <li>
          RAID: A hardware RAID card with at least 1G cache (2G is better). We
          like RAID 5 with 1 hot spare or RAID 6 (with better cards)
        </li>
        <li>
          NIC: We like newer Intel base NICs, but most should work fine (might
          want to get one compatible with PFRING).
        </li>
        <li>
          CPU: At least 2 x 6 cores. The higher the average Gbps, the more
          speed/cores required.

        We are big fans of using Network Packet Brokers ($6k+). They allow
        multiple taps/mirrors to be aggregated and load balanced across multiple
        <code>moloch-capture</code> machines. Read more below.

        Just like with Arkime with commodity hardware, you don’t necessarily have
        to pay a lot of money for a good NPB. Some switch vendors have switches
        that can operate in switch mode or npb mode, so you might already have
        gear laying around you can use.

        On basic commodity hardware, it is easy to get 3Gbps or more, depending
        on the number of CPUs available to Arkime and what else the machine is
        doing. Many times the limiting factor can be the speed of the disks and
        RAID system. See
        <a href="architecture">
          Architecture</a>
        and
        <a href="multihost">
          Multiple Host</a>
        for more information. Arkime allows multiple threads to be used to
        process the packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test the local RAID device use:
        <pre><code>dd bs=256k count=50000 if=/dev/zero of=/THE_ARKIME_PCAP_DIR/test oflag=direct</code></pre>
        To test a NAS leave off the oflag=direct and make sure you test with at least 3x the amount of memory so cache isn't a factor use:
        <pre><code>dd bs=256k count=150000 if=/dev/zero of=/THE_ARKIME_PCAP_DIR/test</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the MAX disk performance. Run several times if desired and take
        the average. If you don’t want to drop any packets, you shouldn’t average
        more then ~80% of the MAX disk performance. If using RAID and don’t want
        drop packets during a future rebuild, ~60% is a better value. Remember
        that most network numbers will be in bits while the disk performance will
        be in bytes, so you’ll need to adjust the values before comparing.

        When you get an error about the capture length not matching the packet
        length, it is <strong>NOT</strong> an issue with Arkime. The issue is
        with the network card settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default modern network cards offload work that the CPUs would need to
        do. They will defragment packets or reassemble tcp sessions and pass the
        results to the host. However this is NOT what we want for packet captures,
        we want what is actually on the network. So you will need to configure
        the network card to turn off all the features that hide the real packets
        from Arkime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sample config files
        (<code>/data/moloch/bin/arkime_config_interfaces.sh</code>) turn off many
        common features but there are still some possible problems:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If using a VM for Arkime, you need to turn off the features on the
          physical interface the vm interface is mapped to
        </li>
        <li>
          If using a fancy card there may be other features that need to be
          turned off.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              You can find them usually with
              <code>ethtool -k INTERFACE | grep on</code> — Anything that is
              still on, turn off and see if that fixes the problem
            </li>
            <li>
              For example
              <code>
                ethtool -K INTERFACE tx off sg off gro off gso off lro off tso off
              </code>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are two work arounds:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If you are reading from a file you can set
          <a href="/settings#readtruncatedpackets"><code>readTruncatedPackets=true</code></a> in the config file, this is
          the only solution for saved .pcap files
        </li>
        <li>
          You can increase the max packet length with <a href="/settings#snaplen"><code>snapLen=65536</code></a>
          in the config file, this is not recommended
        </li>
      </ol>

        <p>
          Please make sure you are using a recent version of Arkime. Constant

          Kernel and TPACKET_V3 support
        </h4>
        <p>
          The most common cause of packet drops with Arkime is leaving the reader
          default of libpcap instead of switching to tpacketv3, pfring or one of
          the other high performance packet readers. We strongly recommend
          tpacketv3, but it does required a newer kernel of 3.2 or later. See

          Network Card Config
        </h4>
        <p>
          Make sure the network card is configured correctly by increasing the ring
          buf to max size and turning off most of the card’s features. The features
          are not useful anyway, since we want to capture what is on the network
          instead of what the local OS sees. Example configuration:
          <pre><code># Set ring buf size, see max with ethool -g eth0
ethtool -G eth0 rx 4096 tx 4096
# Turn off feature, see available features with ethtool -k eth0
ethtool -K eth0 rx off tx off gs off tso off gso off</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          If Arkime was installed from the deb/rpm and the Configure script was
          used, this should already be done in
          <code>/data/moloch/bin/arkime_config_interfaces.sh</code>

        <p>
          The <a href="/settings#packetthreads">packetThreads</a> config option controls the number of threads processing
          the packets, not the number of threads reading the packets off the network card.
          You only need to change the value if you are getting the <code>Packet Q is overflowing</code> error.
          The <a href="/settings#packetthreads">packetThreads</a> option is limited to 24 threads, but usually you only need a few.
          Configuring too many packetThreads is actually worse for performance, please start with a lower number and slowly increase.
          You can also change the size of the packet queue by increasing the <a href="/settings#maxpacketsinqueue">maxPacketsInQueue</a> setting.

          Make sure swap has been disabled, swappiness is 0, or at the very least, isn’t writing to
          the disk being used for PCAP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure the RAID isn’t in the middle of a rebuild or something worse.
          Most RAID cards will have a status of OPTIMAL when things are all good
          and DEGRADED or SUBOPTIMAL when things are bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test the RAID device use:
          <pre><code>dd bs=256k count=50000 if=/dev/zero of=/THE_ARKIME_PCAP_DIR/test oflag=direct</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using <code>xfs</code> make sure you use mount options

        <ul>

          <li>
            Make sure you actually have enough disk write thru capacity and disks.
            For example, for a 1G link with RAID 5 you may need:
            <ul>
              <li>
                At least 4 spindles if using a RAID 5 card with write cache enabled.
              </li>
              <li>
                At least 8 spindles (or more) if using a RAID 5 card with write
                cache disabled.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure your RAID card can actually handle the write rate. Many
            onboard RAID 5 controllers can not handle sustained 1G write rates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switch to RAID 0 from RAID 5 if you can live with the TOTAL data loss
            on a single disk failure.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If using EMC for disks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure write cache is enabled for the LUNs.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is a CX with SATA drives, RAID-3 is optimized for large
            sequential I/O.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor EMC lun queue depth, may be too many hosts sharing it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To check your disk IO run <code>iostat -xm 5</code> and look at the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            wMB/s will give you the current write rate, does it match up with what
            you expect?
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>avgqu-sz</code> should be near or less then 1, otherwise linux is
            queueing instead of doing
          </li>
          <li>
            await should be near or less then 10, otherwise the IO system is slow,
            which will slow <code>moloch-capture</code> down.

        Think of the <code>moloch-capture</code> binary much like you would
        <code>tcpdump</code>.  <code>moloch-capture</code> can listen to live
        network interface(s), or read from historic packet capture files.
        Currently Arkime works best with PCAP files, not pcapng.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          ${arkime_dir}/bin/moloch-capture -c [config_file] -r [pcap_file]
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        For an entire directory, use <code>-R [pcap directory]</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        See
        <code>${arkime_dir}/bin/moloch-capture --help</code> for more info.
        The <code>--monitor</code> to monitor non NFS directories, <code>--skip</code> to skip already loaded pcap files, and <code>-R</code> to process directories are common options.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Arkime is failing to load a PCAP file check the following things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use PCAP formatted files and not pcapng
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the PCAP files contain IP traffic, Arkime currently ignores
          ARP and other traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try running capture with <code>--debug</code> which might warn of not
          understanding the link type or GRE tunnel type. (Please open issues for
          unknown link or GRE types)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Enable Arkime UI to upload</h4>
      <p>
        It is also possible to enable UI in Arkime to upload pcap.
        This is less efficient then just using <code>moloch-capture</code> directly, since it uploads the file and then rules <code>moloch-capture</code> for you.
        Just uncomment the <a href="/settings#uploadcommand"><code>uploadCommand</code></a> in the config.ini file.

      The <strong>easy way</strong> is using the <a href="/settings#interface">interface</a> setting in your config.ini.
      It supports a semicolon ';' separated list of interfaces to listen on for live traffic.
      If you want to set a tag or another field per interface, use the <a href="/settings#interfaceops">interfaceOps</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The <strong>hard way</strong>, you can also have multiple <code>moloch-capture</code> processes,.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arkime by default uses the unqualified hostname as the name of
          the Arkime node, so you’ll need to come up with a naming scheme. Appending
          a, b, c, …​ or the interface number to the hostname are possible methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit <code>/data/moloch/etc/config.ini</code>, and create a section for
          each of the Arkime nodes. Assuming the defaults are correct in the
          <code>[default]</code> section, the only thing that
          <strong>MUST</strong> be set is the interface item. It is also common
          to have each Arkime node talk to a different Elasticsearch node if
          running a cluster of Elasticsearch nodes.
          <pre><code>[arkime-m01a]
interface=eth2
[arkime-m01b]

        </li>
        <li>
          If <code>hostname</code> + <code>domainname</code> on the machine
          doesn’t return a FQDN, you’ll also need to set a viewUrl, or easier
          use the <code>--host</code> option.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create two start up scripts. You will now need to specify the Arkime
          node name with the -n option and change the log files so they are
          separate.
          <pre><code>TDIR=/data/moloch
cd ${TDIR}/bin
/bin/rm -f ${TDIR}/capturea.log.old
/bin/mv ${TDIR}/logs/capturea.log ${TDIR}/logs/capturea.log.old
${TDIR}/bin/moloch-capture -n arkime-m01a -c ${TDIR}/etc/config.ini &gt; ${TDIR}/logs/capturea.log 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
          and
          <pre><code>TDIR=/data/moloch
cd ${TDIR}/bin
/bin/rm -f ${TDIR}/captureb.log.old
/bin/mv ${TDIR}/logs/captureb.log ${TDIR}/logs/captureb.log.old
${TDIR}/bin/moloch-capture -n arkime-m01b -c ${TDIR}/etc/config.ini &gt; ${TDIR}/logs/captureb.log 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
          * Add both scripts to <code>inittab</code> or <code>upstart</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You only need to run <strong>one</strong> viewer on the machine. Unless
        it is started with the <code>-n</code> option, it will still use the
        hostname as the node name, so any special settings need to be set there
        (although default is usually good enough).

      <p>
        Arkime capture supports many options for controlling which packets are
        captured, processed, and saved to disk.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first gatekeeper and most important is the bpf filter,
          <a href="/settings#bpf"><code>bpf=</code></a> in the config file. This filter can be implemented in
          the kernel, the network card, libpcap or network drivers. It is a
          single filter and it controls what Arkime capture "sees" or doesn’t
          "see". Any packet that is dropped because of the bpf filter is usually
          not counted in ANY Arkime stats, but some implementation do expose
          stats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arkime does a high level decode of the ethernet, IP, IP protocol
          information and sees if it understands it. If it doesn’t supports it,
          Arkime will discard the packet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arkime checks the <a href="/settings#packet-drop-ips"><code>packet-drop-ips</code></a> config section to see if
          the IPs involved are marked to be discarded. If there are only a few
          IPs to drop then <a href="/settings#bpf"><code>bpf=</code></a> should be used, otherwise this is
          much more efficient then a huge bpf.
        </li>
        <li>
          For TCP packets, Arkime checks against previous matched against rules
          that set a <code>_dropByDst</code> or <code>_dropBySrc</code> timeout,
          if it matches they will be discarded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arkime picks a packet queue to send the packet to, if the packet queue
          is too busy it will drop the packet. Potentially increase
          <a href="/settings#packetthreads"><code>packetThreads</code></a> or
          <a href="/settings#maxpacketsinqueue"><code>maxPacketsInQueue</code></a> if too
          many packets are being dropped here.
        </li>
        <li>
          A packet queue will start processing a packet and update all the stats
          and basic information for the session the packet is associated with.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sessionSetup rules for first packets in a session are executed,
          which might set operations that control packet saving.
        </li>
        <li>
          If this is the first packet of the session the packet queue will then
          check all the <a href="/settings#dontsavebpfs"><code>dontSaveBPFs</code></a>, and if one matches it will
          save off the max number of packets to save for the session. This will
          override the <a href="/settings#maxpackets"><code>maxPackets</code></a> config setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          If this is the first packet of the session AND no dontSaveBPFs matched,
          the packet queue will then check all the
          <a href="/settings#minpacketssavebpfs"><code>minPacketsSaveBPFs</code></a>
          and save off a min number of packets that must be received.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally Arkime goes to save the packet, if it has already saved the max
          number of packets for the session (set by rules or
          <a href="/settings#dontsavebpf">dontSaveBPFs</a>)
          OR if there was another method (plugin) that said stop saving packets
          for the session the packet won’t be saved.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the number of packets for the session is greater then
          <a href="/settings#maxpackets">maxPackets</a> the session will be saved, a new linked session
          will be started for future packets. The beforeMiddleSave and
          beforeBothSave rules will be executed before saving.
        </li>
        <li>
          The packet queue sends the packet off to the various classifiers and
          parsers to gather more meta data. The afterClassify rules will be
          executed, and if any fields are set during this processing the fieldSet
          rules will be executed. Rules may change if future packets are saved.
        </li>
        <li>
          At some point in the future the session will hit one of the timeouts
          and the session will be saved if there have been enough packets saved
          to meet the min number of packets received setting per session.
          (Defaults to 0) The beforeFinalSave and beforeBothSave rules will be
          executed.

        PCAP deletion is actually handled by the viewer process, so make sure the viewer process is running on all capture boxes.
        The viewer process checks on startup and then every minute to see how much space is available, and if it is below
        <a href="/settings#freespaceg">freeSpaceG</a>, then it will start deleting the oldest file.
        The viewer process will log every time a file is deleted, so you can figure out when a file is deleted if you need to.
        If the viewer complains about not finding the PCAP data, make sure you check the viewer.log.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note</strong>: <a href="/settings#freespaceg">freeSpaceG</a> can also be a percentage,
        with <a href="/settings#freespaceg"><code>freeSpaceG=5%</code></a> for the default.
        The viewer process will always leave at least 10 PCAP files on the disk,
        so make sure there is room for at least <a href="/settings#maxfilesizeg"><code>maxFileSizeG * 10</code></a>
        capture files on disk, or by default 120G.

      <ol>

          Make sure <a href="/settings#freespaceg">freeSpaceG</a> is set correctly for the environment and verify the setting by running viewer with --debug.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure there is free space where viewer is writing its logs.

        <li>
          Make sure viewer can reach Elasticsearch

        <li>
          Make sure that <a href="/settings#dropuser">dropUser</a> or <a href="/settings#dropgroup">dropGroup</a> can
          actually delete files in the pcap directory and has read/execute
          permissions in all parent directories.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the pcap directory is on a filesystem with at least
          <a href="/settings#maxfilesizeg"><code>maxFileSizeG * 10</code></a> space available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the files you think should be deleted show up on the files

        There are several common reasons dontSaveBPFs might not work for you.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you've spelled it dontSaveBPFs, case matters</li>
        <li>Make sure you've placed dontSaveBPFs in the correct section, you can verify by adding a <code>--debug</code> to capture when starting and looking at the output</li>
        <li> Turns out BPF filters are tricky. :)
             When the network is using vlans, then at compile time, BPFs need to know that fact.
             So instead of a nice simple <a href="/settings#dontsavebpfs"><code>dontSaveBPFs=tcp port 443:10</code></a> use something like <code>dontSaveBPFs=tcp port 443 or (vlan and tcp port 443):10</code>.
             Basically <code>FILTER or (vlan and FILTER)</code>. Information from <a href="http://www.christian-rossow.de/articles/tcpdump_filter_mixed_tagged_and_untagged_VLAN_traffic.php" rel="nofollow"> here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Try testing your filter manually with tcpdump, you should only see the traffic you want to drop. So something like <code>tcpdump -i INTERFACE tcp port 443</code> for example.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If still having issues, you might just try out a <a href="rulesformat">Arkime Rules</a> file.
        Arkime converts dontSaveBPFs into a rule for you behind the scenes.

        Arkime buffers writes to disk, which is great for high bandwidth
        networks, but bad for low bandwidth networks. How much data is buffered
        is controlled with <a href="/settings#pcapwritesize"><code>pcapWriteSize</code></a>, which defaults to 262144
        bytes. An important thing to remember is the buffer is per thread, so set
        <a href="/settings#packetthreads"><code>packetThreads</code></a> to 1 on low bandwidth networks.
        A portion of the pcap that is buffered will be written after 10 seconds of no writes.
        However it will still buffer the last pagesize bytes, usually 4096 bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        An error that looks like
        <code>ERROR - processSessionIdDisk - SESSIONID in file FILENAME couldn't read packet at FILEPOS packet # 0 of 2</code>
        usually means that either the pcap is still being buffered and you need to wait for it to be written to disk or
        that previously capture or the host crashed/restarted before the pcap could be written to disk.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also end up with many zero byte pcap files if the disk is full,

      <p>
        In small environments with low amounts of traffic this is possible. With
        Openvswitch you can create mirror port from a physical or virtual adapter
        and send the data to another virtual NIC as the listening interface. In
        KVM, one issue is that it isn’t possible to increase the buffer size past
        256 on the adapter using the Virtio network adapter (mentioned in another
        part of the FAQ). Without Arkime capture will continuously crash. To
        solve this in KVM, use the E1000 adapter, and configure the buffer size
        accordingly. Set up the SPAN port on Openvswitch to send traffic to it:

        This seems to be caused when proxying requests from one viewer node to
        another and the machines don’t use FQDNs for their hostnames and the
        short hostnames are not resolvable by DNS. You can check if your
        machine uses FQDNs by running the <code>hostname</code> command. There
        are several options to resolve the error:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use the <code>--host</code> option on capture
        </li>
        <li>
          Configure the OS to use FQDNs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make it so DNS can resolve the shortnames or add the shortnames to
          the hosts file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit <code>config.ini</code> and add a <code>viewUrl</code> for each
          node. This part of the config file must be the same on all machines
          (we recommend you just use the same config file everywhere). Example:
          <pre><code>[node1_eth0]
interface=eth0
viewUrl=http://node1.fqdn
[node1_eth1]
interface=eth1
viewUrl=http://node1.fqdn
[node2]
interface=eth1
viewUrl=http://node2.fqdn</code></pre>

        How do I proxy Arkime using Apache

      </h3>
      <p>
        Apache, and other web servers, can be used to provide authentication or
        other services for Arkime when setup as a reverse proxy. When a reverse
        proxy is used for authentication it must be inline, and authentication in
        Arkime will not be used, however Arkime will still do the authorization.
        Arkime will use a username that the reverse proxy passes to Arkime as a
        HTTP header for settings and authorization. See the
        <a href="architecture">
          architecture</a>
        page for diagrams. While operators will use the proxy to reach the Arkime
        viewer, the viewer processes still need direct access to each other.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Install Apache, turn on the auth method of your choice. This example
          also uses HTTPS from Apache to Arkime, but if on localhost that isn’t
          required. Configure it to set a special header for Arkime to check.
          In this example <code>ARKIME_USER</code> is the header that is being
          set from a variable, if your auth method already sets a header use
          that.
          <pre><code>AuthType your_auth_method
Require valid-user
RequestHeader set ARKIME_USER %{your_auth_method_concept_of_username_variable_probably_REMOTE_USER}e</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure mod_ssl is loaded, and set up a SSL proxy:
          <pre><code>SSLProxyEngine On
#ProxyRequests On # You probably don't want this line
ProxyPass        /arkime/ https://localhost:8005/ retry=0
ProxyPassReverse /arkime/ https://localhost:8005/</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Restart Apache.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the Arkime UI (by going directly to a non proxy Arkime) make
          sure the "Web Auth Header" is checked for the users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit Arkime’s <code>config.ini</code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Create a new section for the Arkime proxy, you will use <code>-n sectionname</code> so viewer uses that section
            </li>
            <li>
              Set <a href="/settings#usernameheader"><code>userNameHeader</code></a> to the <strong>lower case</strong> version of the header Apache is setting. NOTE - the
              userNameHeader setting is only needed on viewers that apache talks to, don't set on all of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the <a href="/settings#webbasepath"><code>webBasePath</code></a> to the ProxyPath location used above.
              All other sections should <strong>NOT</strong> have a <code>webBasePath</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a <a href="/settings#viewhost"><code>viewHost=localhost</code></a>, so externals can’t just set the <a href="/settings#usernameheader"><code>userNameHeader</code></a> and access Arkime with no auth:
              <pre><code>[arkime-proxy]
userNameHeader=arkime_user
webBasePath = /arkime/
viewPort = 8005
viewHost = localhost</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Start the <code>arkime-proxy</code> viewer, so for this example you would need <code>-n arkime-proxy</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          To prevent the users from going directly to Arkime in the future, scramble their passwords.
          You might want to leave an admin user that doesn’t use the Apache auth.
          Or you can temporarily add one with the <code>addUser.js</code> script.
        </li>
        <li>
          If experiencing issues, try running viewer with --debug

      </h3>
      <p>
        It is possible to search multiple Arkime clusters by setting up a
        special multiple Arkime viewer and a special MultiES process. MultiES
        is similar to Elasticsearch tribe nodes, except it was created before
        tribe nodes and can deal with multiple indexes having the same name.
        Prior to Moloch 1.5, one big limitation currently is that all the
        Moloch clusters have to use the same <a href="/settings#rotateindex"><code>rotateIndex</code></a> setting.
        Since Moloch 1.5 if using different <code>rotateIndex</code> settings,
        use the <a href="/settings#queryallindices"><code>queryAllIndices=true</code></a> setting in the
        <code>molochviewer</code> section. Currently one big limitation is that
        <strong>all Arkime clusters must use the same PasswordSecret</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use MultiES, create another <code>config.ini</code> file or
        section in a shared config file. Both <code>multies.js</code> and the
        special "all" viewer can use the same node name.
        <pre><code># viewer/multies node name (-n allnode)
[allnode]
# The host and port multies is running on, set with multiESHost:multiESPort usually just run on the same host
elasticsearch=127.0.0.1:8200
# This is a special multiple arkime cluster viewer
multiES=true
# Port the multies.js program is listening on, elasticsearch= must match
multiESPort = 8200
# Host the multies.js program is listening on, elasticsearch= must match
multiESHost = localhost
# Semicolon list of elasticsearch instances, one per arkime cluster.  The first one listed will be used for settings
multiESNodes = es-cluster1.example.com:9200;es-cluster2.example.com:9200
# Uncomment if using different rotateIndex settings
#queryAllIndices=true</code></pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you need to start up both the <code>multies.js</code> program and
        <code>viewer.js</code> with the same config file AND <code>-n allnode</code>.
        All other viewer settings, including <a href="/settings#webbasepath"><code>webBasePath</code></a> can still be used.
      </p>
      <p>By default, the users table comes from the first cluster listed in
        <a href="/settings#multiesnodes"><code>multiESNodes</code></a>. This can be overridden by setting
        <a href="/settings#userselasticsearch"><code>usersElasticsearch</code></a> and optionally <a href="/settings#usersprefix"><code>usersPrefix</code></a>
        in the multi viewer config file.

        Then, you need start MutilES adding <strong>NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS</strong>
        environment variable specifying the path to file you just created, for
        example:
        <pre><code>NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./CAcerts.pem /data/moloch/bin/node multies.js -c /data/moloch/etc/config.ini -n allnode</pre></code>

        Viewers have the ability to proxy traffic for each other. The ability

        <ol>
          <li>
            Each <code>moloch-capture</code> gets a nodename, either by the

          <li>
            Each <code>moloch-capture</code> writes a stats record every few

            the <code>-n</code> command line option or everything in front of the
            first period of the hostname.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the SPI record nodename is the same as the <code>arkime-viewer</code>
            nodename it can be processed locally, STOP HERE. This is the common
            case with one arkime node.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the <code>stats[nodename].hostname</code> is the same as the
            <code>arkime-viewer</code>’s hostname (exact match) then it can be
            processed locally, STOP HERE.
            Remember this is written by capture above, either the FQDN or <code>--host</code>.
            This is the common case with multiple capture processes per capture node.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we make it here, the pcap data isn’t local and it must be proxied.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a <code>viewUrl</code> set in the <code>[nodename]</code> section, use that.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a viewUrl set in the <code>[default]</code> section, use that.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use
            <code>
              stats[nodename].hostname:[nodename section - viewPort setting]
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use
            <code>
              stats[nodename].hostname:[default section - viewPort setting]
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use <code>stats[nodename].hostname:8005</code>

          First, look at <code>viewer.log</code> on both the viewer machine and
          the remote machine and see if there are any obvious errors. The most
          common problems are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Not using the same <code>config.ini</code> on all nodes can make
            things a pain to debug and sometimes not even work. It is best to
            use the same config with different sections for each node name
            <code>[nodename]</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            The remote machine doesn’t return a FQDN from the
            <code>hostname</code> command AND the viewer machine can’t resolve
            just the hostname. To fix this, do ONE of the following:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Use the <code>--host</code> option to <code>moloch-capture</code> and restart capture
              </li>
              <li>
                Make it so the remote machines returns a FQDN
                (<code>hostname "fullname"</code> as root and edit
                <code>/etc/sysconfig/network</code>)
              </li>
              <li>
                Set a <code>viewUrl</code> in each node section of the
                <code>config.ini</code>. If you don’t have a node section for
                each host, you’ll need to create one.
              </li>
              <li>
                Edit <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and add
                <code>search foo.example.com</code>, where
                <code>foo.example.com</code> is the subdomain of the hosts.
                Basically, you want it so "telnet shortname 8005" works on the
                viewer machine to the remote machine.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            The remote machine’s FQDN doesn’t match the CN or SANs in the cert it
            is presenting. The fixes are the same as #2 above.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remote machine is using a self signed cert. To fix this, either
            turn off HTTPS or see the certificate answer above.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remote machine can’t open the PCAP.
            Make sure the <a href="/settings#dropuser"><code>dropUser</code></a> user or <a href="/settings#dropgroup"><code>dropGroup</code></a> group can read the pcap files.
            Check the directories in the path too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure all viewers are either using HTTPS or not using HTTPS, if
            only some are using HTTPS then you need to set <code>viewUrl</code>
            for each node.
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                When troubleshooting this issue, it is sometimes easier to
                disable HTTPS everywhere
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to change the hostname of a capture node:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Change your mind :)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reuse the same node name as previously with a <code>-n</code> option
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the <code>viewUrl</code> for that old node name that points to the new host.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <p>
        Arkime uses Node.js for the viewer component, and requires many
        packages to work fully. These packages must be compiled with and run
        using the same version of Node.js. An error like <code>…​ was compiled
        against a different Node.js version using NODE_MODULE_VERSION 48. This
        version of Node.js requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 57.</code> means that
        the version of Node.js used to install the packages and run the
        packages are different.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shouldn’t happen when using the prebuilt Arkime releases. If it
        does, then double check that <code>/data/moloch/bin/node</code> is
        being used to run viewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you built Arkime yourself, this usually happens if you have a
        different version of node in your path. You will need to rebuild Arkime
        and either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remove the OS version of node
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure <code>/data/moloch/bin</code> is in your path before the OS
          version of node
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the <code>--install</code> option to easybutton which will add to
          the path for you
        </li>

        Parliament is designed to run behind a reverse proxy such as Apache.
        Basically, you just need to tell Apache to send all root requests and any
        <code>/parliament</code> requests to the Parliament server.

        Here is the common check list:

        <li>
          Check that WISE is running
          <pre><code>curl http://localhost:8081/fields</code></pre>
          You should see a list of fields that wise knows about.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check in your config.ini file you've added
          <ul>
            <li> <code>wise.so</code> to the <a href="/settings#plugins"><code>plugins=</code></a> line.</li>
            <li> <code>wise.js</code> to the <a href="/settings#viewerplugins"><code>viewerPlugins=</code></a> line.</li>
            <li> <a href="/wise#wiseso-settings"><code>wiseURL</code></a> has been set, or the older <code>wiseHost</code> and <code>wisePort</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Check that from the capture/viewer hosts you can reach the viewer hosts and there are no ACL issues.
          <pre><code>curl http://WISEHOST:8081/fields</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Restart <code>moloch-capture</code> after adding a
          <code>--debug</code> option may print out useful information what is
          wrong.  Look to make sure that wise is being called with the correct URL.
          Verify that the plugins, wiseHost and wiseURL setting is what you actually think it is.
