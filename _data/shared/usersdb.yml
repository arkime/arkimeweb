name: Users Database

before: |
  <p>
    The Arkime applications store all the users in OpenSearch/Elasticsearch.
    Since you will have multiple Arkime clusters and applications, Arkime allows you to share the database to use.
    When these settings aren't use Arkime will fallback to using a non shared Users Database for viewer/capture.
  </p>


settings:
  - key: usersElasticsearchAPIKey
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      (Since 3.0.0) Use an Elasticsearch API key for users DB access without requiring basic authentication.
      See <a href="#elasticsearchAPIKey">elasticsearchAPIKey setting</a> for information on creating and encoding an Elasticsearch API Key.
      See <a href="#userselasticsearch">usersElasticsearch setting</a> for information about the Users DB.

  - key: usersElasticsearchBasicAuth
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      (Since 3.1.0) Use basic auth with OpenSearch/Elasticsearch for Users DB.
      See <a href="#elasticsearchBasicAuth">elasticsearchBasicAuth setting</a> for information
      on creating and encoding an OpenSearch/Elasticsearch Basic Auth.
      See <a href="#userselasticsearch">usersElasticsearch setting</a>
      for information about the Users DB.
      All Arkime versions also support http://user:pass@hostname:port in the usersElasticsearch setting.

  - key: usersPrefix
    value: '[PREFIX] if <a href="#prefix">prefix</a> set otherwise EMPTY'
    text: |
      Like prefix but only for the users information if <a href=#usersElasticsearch>usersElasticsearch</a> set.

  - key: usersElasticsearch
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Set this option to a shared OpenSearch/Elasticsearch cluster to use for the users index.
      This allows multiple Arkime clusters to share the same users index, so that the same accounts and settings work across all Arkime clusters.
      The <a href="#elasticsearch">elasticsearch</a> setting should use a unique OpenSearch/Elasticsearch cluster per Arkime cluster and the usersElasticsearch setting should use a single shared OpenSearch/Elasticsearch cluster.
      <br>
      A comma separated list of urls to use to connect to the users OpenSearch/Elasticsearch cluster is supported.
      If OpenSearch/Elasticsearch requires a user/password those can be placed in the url also, http://user:pass@hostname:port or use <a href="#usersElasticsearchBasicAuth">usersElasticsearchBasicAuth</a>
      <br>
      (Since 3.0) This setting applys to shortcuts too! Shortcuts will be saved in the usersElasticsearch.
      <strong>Note:</strong> <a href="#cronqueries">cronQueries</a> also has to be set in order for shortcuts to be saved to the usersElasticsearch and synced to each cluster.

  - key: passwordSecret
    value: "password"
    text: |
      Password hash secret - Must be in [default] section of the config file, and all viewers in the arkime cluster must have the same value.
      Since OpenSearch/Elasticsearch is wide open by default, we encrypt the stored password hashes with this so a malicious person can't insert a working new account.
      It is also used for secure server-to-server communication if serverSecret is not set a different value.
      Don't set if you do not want user authentication.
      Changing the value will make all previously stored passwords no longer work.
