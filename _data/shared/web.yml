  <p>
    For Arkime applications that have a web interface there are common settings for listening for web traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
    These settings should live in the <code>[cont3xt]</code>, <code>[parliament]</code>, <code>[wiseService]</code> or <code>[default]</code> sections depending on the Arkime application.

settings:
  - key: webBasePath
    value: "/"

      When configuring Arkime behind a reverse proxy, it's essential to specify the <code>webBasePath</code> to ensure correct request routing and cookie management.
      For instance, if Arkime is accessed via <code>https://example.com/arkime</code>, set <code>webBasePath=/arkime/</code> to direct requests appropriately.
      This setting must include a trailing slash (/) to avoid issues.
      It's also recommended to strip this base path in the reverse proxy configuration to ensure seamless integration.
      <strong>Note:</strong> Avoid setting <code>webBasePath</code> in the <code>[default]</code> section for viewer configurations; it should only be applied in the node-specific sections.

  - key: certFile
    value: EMPTY

  - key: keyFile
    value: EMPTY

      be used. certFile must also be set.
