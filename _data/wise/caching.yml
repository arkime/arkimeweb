name: Caching

  <p>
    The wiseService caches all results returned by external sources.
    An external source is something like OpenDNS or Reverse DNS, where it is impossible to load the entire data set into memory and WISE needs to make a external query to obtain results.
    All caching is done in memory, however Redis can be used for a larger shared cache.
    <br>
    Create a <code>[cache]</code> section
  </p>

settings:
  - key: type
    value: memory
    text: <code>memory</code> or <code>redis</code> are supported

  - key: url
    value: empty
    text: For cache engines this is the url to connect to. For redis the format is <code>[redis:]//[[user][:password@]]host:port[/db-number]</code>
