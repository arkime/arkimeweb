  <p>
    Redis can be used as a wise data source.
    If using redis as a wise cache you'll probably want to use a different redis "database" by specifying the database number in the url. Example: `url=redis://localhost/1`
    Each redis source can only handle one type of data, although multiple redis sources can be configured and they can use the same redis database.
    <br>
    Create a <code>[redis:UNIQUENAME]</code> section to configure.
