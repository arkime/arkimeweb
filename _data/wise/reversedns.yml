  <p>
    For IPs that are included by the ips setting, do a reverse lookup and place everything before the first dot in the field specified.
    <br>
    Create a <code>[reversedns]</code> section to configure
  </p>

settings:
  - key: field
    value: REQUIRED
    text: The field to set with the hostname

  - key: ips
    value: REQUIRED
    text: Semicolon separated list of IPs or CIDRs to lookups. Ips that don't match this list will NOT be reverse lookuped.

  - key: servers
    value: EMPTY
    text: Since 1.6.1, if set the reversedns source will use the semicolon separated list of ip addresses to reverse lookuped.

  - key: stripDomains
    value: EMPTY
    text: If EMPTY then all domains are stripped after the FIRST period. When set ONLY domains that match the semicolon separated list of domain names are modified, and only the matching part is removed. Those that don't match will be saved in full. The list is checked in order. A leading dot is recommended. For example `stripDomains=.foo.example.com;.example.com` will convert `test1.foo.example.com` to `test1`, `test2.bar.example.com` to `test2.bar` and finally `test3.bar.com` to `test3.bar.com` - Added in 0.11.4

  - key: cacheSize
    value: 200000
    text: Maximum number of results to cache
