before: |
  <p>
    (Since 5.0.0) These settings must be in the [parliament] section, either in their own file or in shared configuration file.
    The issues <code>file</code> setting must exist and is set to your Parliament JSON file.
  </p>
  <p>
    When upgrading to 5.x of Parliament there are some important changes.
    If you were passing in port/certFile/keyFile into the command line arguments when starting Parliament, you must also include those in this configuration file.
    It is recommended that you configure the Auth section in the Parliament UI on the Setting page before upgrading to 5.x.
    The upgrade will update the configuration with your authentication settings, otherwise you will need to input them manually as
    basic passworth auth has been disabled for Parliament.
