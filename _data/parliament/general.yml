  <p>
    (Since 5.0.0) Must be in the [parliament] section. This can be in its own file or in the viewer config.
    This config must exist and point to your Parliament JSON file using the <code>file</code> setting.
    If you were passing in port/certFile/keyFile into the command line arguments when starting Parliament, you must also include those in this config.
    It is recommended that you configure the Auth section in the Parliament UI on the Setting page before upgrading.
    The upgrade will update the config with your auth settings. Otherwise you will need to input them manually as
    basic passworth auth has been disabled for Parliament.
