  <p>
    With Arkime "views" are how the SPI data is displayed in the Sessions
    tab. Usually there is a unique "view" for each category of data. You
    can add custom views to Arkime several ways, including the wise and
    tagger plugins. Since Arkime 1.5.2 the easiest way is to use a
    [custom-views] section in the ini file. At viewer startup, a new
    section will be created for each entry. The format of the line is
    <code>name=definition</code>. Viewer will sort all views by name when
    choosing the order to display in.
