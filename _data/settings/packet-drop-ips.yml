  <p>This section allows you to specify ips or cidrs to drop
    from being processed. This is different from a bpf filter since the
    packets will actually reach capture (and counted) but won't be
    fully processed. However if you have many ranges/ips to drop it can be
    more efficient then bpfs. It is possible to also allow ranges inside of
    dropped ranges using the "allow" keyword. Order added doesn't matter,
    searching always finds the best match.

  <pre><code>[packet-drop-ips]
  10.0.0.0/8=drop
  10.10.0.0/16=allow
  10.10.10.0/24=drop
  10.10.10.10=allow
