  <p>
    Starting with Arkime 5.0 it is now possible to remap results returned by WISE or
    the tagger plugin to set different fields based on what field matched.
    For example instead of only being able to set the asset field based
    on if the ip.src or ip.dst field matched, it is now possible to
    set asset.src when ip.src matches or asset.dst when ip.dst matches.
    This is done by remapping the asset field.

    Example:
  </p>
  <pre><code>[custom-fields-remap]
  asset=ip.src=asset.src;ip.dst=asset.dst

  [custom-fields]
  asset.src=kind:lotermfield;count:true;friendly:Asset Src;db:assetName.src;help:Asset Name Src
  asset.dst=kind:lotermfield;count:true;friendly:Asset Dst;db:assetName.dst;help:Asset Name Dst
  </code></pre>

settings:
  - key: "[oldField]="
    value: Unique field expression
    text: The field that we want to remap

  - key: "matchField=newField"
    value: EMPTY
    text: When the value we are matching against is 'match field' instead of setting 'oldField' we set 'newField'
