    Arkime does <strong>NOT</strong> support having pcapDir and the OpenSearch/Elasticsearch data directory on the same file system.
    Arkime will <strong>NOT</strong> work in this configuration.
    It is strongly recommended running capture and OpenSearch/Elasticsearch on different hosts, if that is not possible, use different disks or file systems.

settings:
  - key: freeSpaceG
    value: "5%"
    text: |
      Can be specified either as percentage (<code>freeSpaceG=2%</code>) or the number of gigabytes (<code>freeSpaceG=150</code>) that should be kept available on the <a href="#pcapDir">pcapDir</a> disk(s).
      Viewer will delete PCAP files to try and maintain at least this much free space at all times.
      Viewer will NOT delete the corresponding session records in OpenSearch/Elasticsearch, instead that is done either by <code>db.pl expire</code> script or using ILM/ISM.
      See the <a href="faq#pcap-deletion">FAQ</a> if you are having issues with this setting.

  - key: pcapDir
    value: (Since 5.5.0) /opt/arkime/raw (before 5.5.0) EMPTY
    text: |
      Semicolon separated list of directories to save pcap files to.
      The directory to save pcap to is picked using round robin by default, see <a href="#pcapdiralgorithm">pcapDirAlgorithm</a> for more options.
      It is <strong>important</strong> that ALL parent directories of the pcapDir have the execute bit set so that either the <a href="#dropUser">dropUser</a> or <a href="#dropGroup">dropGroup</a> can enter the directory.
      The actual pcapDir should either be owned by the <a href="#dropUser">dropUser</a> or have the group <a href="#dropGroup">dropGroup</a> and have write permission.


  - key: pcapDirTemplate
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      When set, this strftime template is appended to
      pcapDir and allows multiple directories to be created based on time.

  - key: pcapDirAlgorithm
    value: "round-robin"
    text: |
      When <a href="#pcapDir">pcapDir</a> is a list of directories, this determines how Arkime
      chooses which directory to use for each new pcap file.
      <br>
      Possible values: round-robin (rotate sequentially),
      max-free-percent (choose the directory on the filesystem
      with the highest percentage of available space),
      max-free-bytes (choose the directory on the filesystem
      with the highest number of available bytes).

  - key: maxFileTimeM
    value: 0
    text: |
      The max time in minutes between rotating pcap files. Useful if
      there is an external utility that needs to look for closed files
      every so many minutes. Setting to 0 means only use
      maxFileSizeG

  - key: maxFileSizeG
    value: 12 (since 4.0.0)<br>4 (before 4.0)
    text: |
      The approximate max raw pcap file size in gigabytes.
      The disk should have room for at least 10*maxFileSizeG files.
