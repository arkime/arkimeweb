  - key: freeSpaceG
    value: "5%"
    text: |
      Delete pcap files when free space is lower then this. This does
      NOT delete the session records in the database. It is recommended
      this value is between 5% and 10% of the disk. Database deletes
      are done by the db.pl expire. Can also be specified using a
      percentage.

  - key: pcapDir
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Semicolon separated list of directories to save pcap files to.
      The directory to save pcap to is picked using round robin by default, see <a href="#pcapdiralgorithm">pcapDirAlgorithm</a> for more options.


  - key: pcapDirTemplate
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      When set, this strftime template is appended to
      pcapDir and allows multiple directories to be created based on time.

  - key: pcapDirAlgorithm
    value: "round-robin"
    text: |
      When pcapDir is a list of directories, this determines how Arkime
      chooses which directory to use for each new pcap file.
      <br>
      Possible values: round-robin (rotate sequentially),
      max-free-percent (choose the directory on the filesystem
      with the highest percentage of available space),
      max-free-bytes (choose the directory on the filesystem
      with the highest number of available bytes).
