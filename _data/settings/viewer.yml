  - key: cronQueries
    value: "false"
    text: |
      Set on <strong>ONE</strong> viewer node per cluster, this viewer node will perform all the cron queries and hunts for the cluster.

      <br>

    value: "1"
    text: |
      Specify the max number of indices we calculate spidata for, or set to -1 to disable any max.
      OpenSearch/Elasticsearch MAY blow up if we allow the spiData to search too many indices.

  - key: titleTemplate
    value: "_cluster_ - _page_ _-view_ _-expression_"
    text: |
      <ul class="mb-0">

          _cluster_ = ES cluster name
        </li>
        <li>
          _userId_ = logged in User Id

  - key: certFile
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Public certificate to use for https, if not set then http will be
      used. keyFile must also be set.

  - key: keyFile
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Private certificate to use for https, if not set then http will
      be used. certFile must also be set.

  - key: viewerPlugins
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Semicolon separated list of viewer plugins to load and the
      order to load them in. Must include the trailing .js

  - key: viewHost
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      The ip used to listen, usually localhost for just the localhost or 0.0.0.0 for all ips.
      See the <code>host</code> section of
      <a class="no-decoration"
        href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_callback"
        rel="nofollow">https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_callback</a>

  - key: viewPort
    value: "8005"
    text: |
      This is both the port that the viewer process listens on AND the port we try to connect to other viewer proceses on when proxing.
      We recommend all viewers use the same port so it can be set in the [default] section.
      If viewers can't listen on the same ports then set the one in [default] to the common one, and the one in [NODE] to the special port.

  - key: viewUrl
    value: "http[s]://hostname:[viewport]"
    text: |
      This shouldn't be needed anymore, but it allows you to over load both the host and port for talking to a remote node.
      See <a href="/faq#error-couldn-t-connect-to-remote-viewer-only-displaying-spi-data">How do viewers find each other</a>.
      It is much better to use FQDNs on capture nodes, or start capture with the --host option.

  - key: webBasePath
    value: "/"
    text: |
      The base url for Arkime web requests.
      Must end with a / or bad things will happen.
      This setting is meant to be used when using a reverse proxy talking to multiviewer or central viewers.
      Do not set in the [default] section, only in a section that matches the node name of the multiviewer/central viewer.

  - key: arkimeWebURL
    value: "http[s]://hostName:[viewPort]/[webBasePath]"
    text: |
      (since 3.0)
      The website URL for Arkime. Used to create links to the Arkime web
      UI. Must end with a / or bad things will happen. You can include
      the "http(s)://" or exclude it. If excluded, http/https will be
      set by determining whether a keyFile and certFile exist.

  - key: accessLogFile
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      If left empty, then the viewer will log to stdout. It can be set to a filename and then logging will
      be directed there.

  - key: accessLogFormat
    value: |
      :date :username %1b[1m:method%1b[0m %1b[33m:url%1b[0m :status :res[content-length] bytes :response-time ms
    text: |
      (Since 2.3) Set the log record format -- this uses Express Morgan. The string is URL Encoded and so uses %xx
      to escape special characters.
      See the Morgan documentation for the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/morgan">list of keywords</a>.

  - key: accessLogSuppressPaths
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      (Since 2.3) This is a semi-colon seperated list of URL paths which should <em>not</em> be logged.
      Setting this to /eshealth.json will suppress logging of all calls to that endpoint.

  - key: aes256Encryption
    value: |
      forced true (since 4.0)<br>
      true (since 2.4.0)<br>
      false (before 2.4.0)
    text: |
      (Since 2.2.0) Use better encryption when talking between viewer nodes


  - key: hstsHeader
    value: "false"
    text: |
      From viewer, return a hsts header on responses

  - key: huntWarn
    value: "100000"
    text: |
      (Since 1.6.0) Warn users when creating a hunt if more then this
      many sessions will be searched

  - key: huntLimit
    value: "1000000"
    text: |
      (Since 1.6.0) Do not create hunts for non admin users if more
      then this many sessions will be searched

  - key: huntAdminLimit
    value: "10000000"
    text: |
      (Since 1.6.0) Do not create hunts for admin users if more then
      this many sessions will be searched

  - key: iframe
    value: deny
    text: |
      Used to set the <code>X-Frame-Options</code> header for putting
      Arkime in an iFrame. Options include "deny", "notallowed", or a
      URL to allow from.

  - key: uploadCommand
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      If set uploads from the UI are allowed.  An upload saves the file and runs capture on it, so its better to just run capture instead of using upload if you can.
      Example setting would be <code>/opt/arkime/bin/capture --copy -n {NODE} -r {TMPFILE} -c {CONFIG} {TAGS}</code>.  <br>
      The following templated values will be filled in for you:
      <ul>
        <li>NODE - The node name of the viewer that received the upload</li>
        <li>TMPFILE - The tmp file name uploaded to</li>
        <li>CONFIG - The config file path used to start viewer</li>
        <li>TAGS - The tags set with the upload</li>
        <li>INSECURE-ORIGINALNAME - DO NOT USE!!! The full original name of the uploaded file, using this will make it EASY to take over your host. DO NOT USE!!!</li>
      </ul>

  - key: uploadFileSizeLimit
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      (Since 2.0) If set, the max size of pcap files that can be uploaded from the UI

  - key: queryAllIndices
    value: "false for viewer, true for multiviewer"
    text: |
      (Since 1.5.0) Always query all indices instead of trying to
      calculate which ones. Use this if searching across that use
      different rotateIndex values.

  - key: valueAutoComplete
    value: "true for viewer, false for multiviewer"
    text: |
      Autocomplete field values in the search expression.
