  - key: cronQueries
    value: "false"
    text: |
      Set on <strong>ONE</strong> viewer node per cluster, this viewer node will perform all the cron queries and hunts for the cluster.
      If you do NOT set this on a cluster then hunts and cron queries can be created but will never run.
      <br>
      (Since 3.0) If <a href="#userselasticsearch">usersElasticsearch</a> is set, this viewer node will sync shortcuts from the usersElasticsearch to the local OpenSearch/Elasticsearch.
      <br>
      (Since 4.3.1) Add "auto" setting that will self select a node to be the primary Arkime viewer node, when that node dies another node will become the primary Arkime viewer node. Do not use when another node is using "true'.

  - key: spiDataMaxIndices
    value: "1"
    text: |
      Specify the max number of indices we calculate spidata for, or set to -1 to disable any max.
      OpenSearch/Elasticsearch MAY blow up if we allow the spiData to search too many indices.

  - key: titleTemplate
    value: "_cluster_ - _page_ _-view_ _-expression_"
    text: |
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>
          _cluster_ = OpenSearch/Elasticsearch cluster name
        </li>
        <li>
          _userId_ = logged in User Id
        </li>
        <li>
          _userName_ = logged in User Name

          _expression_ = current search expression if set, otherwise
          blank
        </li>
        <li>
          _-expression_ = " - " + current search expression if set,
          otherwise blank, prior spaces removed
        </li>
        <li>
          _view_ = current view if set, otherwise blank

      order to load them in. Must include the trailing .js

  - key: viewHost

      <a class="no-decoration"

        rel="nofollow">https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_callback</a>

  - key: viewPort
    value: "8005"
    text: |
      This is both the port that the viewer process listens on AND the port we try to connect to other viewer proceses on when proxing.
      We recommend all viewers use the same port so it can be set in the [default] section.
      If viewers can't listen on the same ports then set the one in [default] to the common one, and the one in [NODE] to the special port.

  - key: viewUrl
    value: "http[s]://hostname:[viewport]"
    text: |
      This shouldn't be needed anymore, but it allows you to over load both the host and port for talking to a remote node.
      See <a href="/faq#error-couldn-t-connect-to-remote-viewer-only-displaying-spi-data">How do viewers find each other</a>.
      It is much better to use FQDNs on capture nodes, or start capture with the --host option.

  - key: arkimeWebURL
    value: "http[s]://hostName:[viewPort]/[webBasePath]"
    text: |
      (since 3.0)

      UI. Must end with a / or bad things will happen. You can include
      the "http(s)://" or exclude it. If excluded, http/https will be
      set by determining whether a keyFile and certFile exist.

  - key: aes256Encryption

      forced true (since 4.0)<br>

      URL to allow from.

  - key: uploadCommand
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      If set uploads from the UI are allowed.  An upload saves the file and runs capture on it, so its better to just run capture instead of using upload if you can.
      Example setting would be <code>/opt/arkime/bin/capture --copy -n {NODE} -r {TMPFILE} -c {CONFIG} {TAGS}</code>.  <br>
      The following templated values will be filled in for you:
      <ul>

        <li>TMPFILE - The tmp file name uploaded to</li>
        <li>CONFIG - The config file path used to start viewer</li>
        <li>TAGS - The tags set with the upload</li>
        <li>INSECURE-ORIGINALNAME - DO NOT USE!!! The full original name of the uploaded file, using this will make it EASY to take over your host. DO NOT USE!!!</li>
      </ul>
