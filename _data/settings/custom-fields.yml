  <p>
    You can add custom fields to Arkime several ways, including the wise
    and tagger plugins. Since Arkime 1.5.2 the easiest way is to use a
    [custom-fields] section in the ini file. At capture startup it will
    check to make sure all those fields exist in the database. The format
    of the line is the similar as used in wise and tagger, except you use
    <code>expression=definition</code>. You will need to also create a
    [custom-views] section to display the data on the Sessions tab.
