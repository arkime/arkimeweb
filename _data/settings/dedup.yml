  <p>
    Arkime since version 2.7.1 has supported basic packet deduplication.
    The deduplication is done early in the pipeline before a packet queue is assigned.
    Currently only the iphdr + tcphdr or iphdr + udphdr is used to find duplicate packets, ignoring the TTL field.
    The deduplication will only look back a configured number of seconds.

  <p>
    The packet deduplication is an expensive CPU task, so you should monitor the "Dup Drops/s" column in capture stats to see if worthwhile.
