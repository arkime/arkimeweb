  <p>
    WISE also lets you configure which fields are used for the standard WISE types and you can add your own WISE types.
    You do this by creating a <code>[wise-types]</code> section in the capture configuration file AND listing the fields using `{type}={expression};{db:dbfield}...`.
    The type field must be less than 12 characters, and is the same type field you would use in the WISE service.
