    text: |
      The path to an offline pcap directory to find pca files in.
      There can be multiple -R options on the command line.

      Override the OS hostname for this capture instance.
      The viewer will use this hostname when trying to find the packets for this node, see <a href="/faq#how-do-viewers-find-each-other">the FAQ</a> for more information on how nodes find each other..
      The hostname should be a FQDN to make life easier.

  - key: -t, --tag {tag}
