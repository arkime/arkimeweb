    The With Intelligence See Everything (WISE) plugin is used to communicate with the wiseService Arkime application.

  <p>
    Each capture node needs to have the WISE plugin enabled.
    You will need to make a few changes to the <code>[default]</code> section of the configuration file.
    <ol>
      <li> Add <code>wiseURL=http://WISEHOST:8081</code></li>
      <li> Enable the plugin by adding <code>wise.so</code> to the `plugins=` variable, it should be the <strong>last entry</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

    Each viewer node that an operator uses needs to have the WISE plugin enabled.
    You will need to make a few changes to the <code>[default]</code> section of the configuration file.
    <ol>
      <li>Add <code>wiseURL=http://WISEHOST:8081</code></li>
      <li>Enable the plugin by adding <code>wise.js</code> to the <code>viewerPlugins=</code> variable.</li>
    </ol>

    WISE also lets you configure which fields are used for the standard WISE types and you can add your own WISE types.
    You do this by creating a <code>[wise-types]</code> section in the capture configuration file AND listing the fields using `{type}={expression};{db:dbfield}...`.
    The type field must be less than 12 characters, and is the same type field you would use in the WISE service.
