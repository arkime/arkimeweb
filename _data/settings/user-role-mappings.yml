  <p>
    Starting with 5.4.1 it is now possible to dynamically update the roles associated with a user when using header or oidc authMode.
    When using this section, all roles you are using must be defined, one per line, and any role no longer enabled for the user will be removed.
    The rules are evaluated on login, and the user's roles are updated accordingly.
    To ensure immediate role changes, manually edit the user's roles on the Users tab, as automated updates require a user login.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each line is of the format <code>rolename=javascript expression</code>.
    The javascript expression can use two variable, <code>this</code> which allows you to reference any user fields and <code>vals</code> which allows you to access any of the request headers for header auth or the oidc info for oidc auth.

    Example:

  <pre><code>[user-role-mappings]
  # Everyone is arkimeUser
  arkimeUser=true
  # userAdmin have -svc extension in userId
  userAdmin=this.userId.endsWith('-svc')
  # fred and wilma are superAdmin
  superAdmin=this.userId === 'fred' || this.userId === 'wilma'
  # custom role based on header value
  role-special=vals.roles.includes('special')
  </code></pre>
