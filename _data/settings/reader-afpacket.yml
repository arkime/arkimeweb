  <p>
    AFPacket v3 also known as Tpacketv3, is the preferred reader for Arkime and can be used on most
    3.x or later kernels. Configure capture to use tpacketv3 as the reader
    method with <code>pcapReadMethod=tpacketv3</code> in your configuration
    file.

  <pre>[default]
  pcapReadMethod=tpacketv3
  tpacketv3BlockSize=2097152
  interface=eth0
  tpacketv3NumThreads=2</pre>


settings:
  - key: tpacketv3BlockSize
    value: "2097152"
    text: |
      The block size in bytes used for reads from each interface. There are 120 blocks per interface.

  - key: tpacketv3NumThreads
    value: "2"
    text: |
      The number of threads used to read packets from each interface. These threads take the packets from the AF packet interface and place them into the packet queues.

  - key: tpacketv3ClusterId
    value: "8005"
    text: |
      (Since 2.0) The cluster id for use with PACKET_FANOUT. The error <code>Error setting packet fanout parameters: tpacketv3ClusterId: 8005 (Invalid argument)</code> usually means the interface is DOWN and needs to be brought UP.

  - key: tpacketv3OldVlan
    value: false
    text: |
      (Since 6.0) Set to true to use the old VLAN handling method where AFPacket would strip the first VLAN tag and not save in the PCAP. The new default will add the VLAN tag back into the packet data before saving to PCAP.
