    Since version 2.7.0, Arkime supports processing PCAP-Over-Ip requests.
    Two modes are support client and server.
    Client mode will connect to a pcap-over-ip service, server will listen for pcap-over-ip connections.

  <p>
    Client mode is set by using <code>pcapReadMethod=pcap-over-ip-client</code>.
    The <code>interface</code> setting must have a list of hosts and optional ports to connect to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Server mode is set by using <code>pcapReadMethod=pcap-over-ip-server</code>.
    The <code>interface</code> setting is ignored and should just be set to <code>dummy</code>.
