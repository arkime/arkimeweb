    Since version 2.7.0, Arkime supports processing PCAP-Over-IP requests.
    Two modes are supported: client and server.
    Client mode connects to a PCAP-Over-IP service, while server mode listens for PCAP-Over-IP connections.

    Client mode is set by using <code>pcapReadMethod=pcap-over-ip-client</code>.
    The <code>interface</code> setting must have a list of hosts and optional ports to connect to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Server mode is set by using <code>pcapReadMethod=pcap-over-ip-server</code>.
    The <code>interface</code> setting is ignored and should just be set to <code>dummy</code>.
