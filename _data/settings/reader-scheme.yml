name: "Reader - Offline Scheme"
before: |
  <p>
    Arkime 5 introduces the concept of reader schemes to process offline pcap files from multiple local and remote locations.
    Support for new schemes can be built into capture/viewer or added with a plugin.
    When a scheme is used to process an offline pcap file, which scheme is used and information about the file is stored in Arkime files index for viewer to use.
    The schemes run in a dedicated thread, which will make file processing faster then previous versions.
    Switching to "scheme" mode vs libpcap-file mode is done either by using -r with any scheme OR the --scheme option.
    It is all or nothing, once in scheme mode, non scheme supported command line options will be ignored with no warning.

  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>file:///fullpath</dt>
    <dd>Process a file on the local disk</dd>

    <dt>s3://bucket/key</dt>
    <dd>Process a file that lives in s3</dd>

    <dt>s3http(s)://host(:port)/bucket/key</dt>
    <dd>Process a file using s3 protocol but use a certain host, useful with minio for example</dd>

    <dt>http(s)://host(:port)/path</dt>
    <dd>Process a file using http range requests</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    So for example <code>./capture -r http://hostname/foo.pcap -r s3://pcapbucket/file.pcap</code> will process 2 files.
