name: "Reader - Offline Scheme"
before: |
  <p>
    Arkime 5.0.0 introduces the concept of reader schems to process to process pcap files from multiple local and report locations.
    Support for new schemes can be built into capture/viewer or added with a plugin.
    When a scheme is used to process an offline pcap file, which is used and information about the file is stored in Arkime for viewer to use.
    The schemes run in a single thread, which will make file processing faster then previous version.
    Switching to "scheme" mode vs libpcap-file mode is done either by using -r with any scheme OR the --scheme option.
    It is all or nothing, once in scheme mode, non scheme supported command line options will be ignored with no warning.

  <dl>
    <dt>file:///fullpath</dt>
    <dd>- Process a file on the local disk</dd>

    <dt>s3://bucket/key</dt>
    <dd>- Process a file that lives in s3</dd>

    <dt>s3http(s)://host(:port)/bucket/key</dt>
    <dd>- Process a file using s3 protocol but use a certain host, useful with minio for example</dd>

    <dt>http(s)://host(:port)/path</dt>
    <dd>- Process a file using http range requests</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    So for example <code>./capture -r http://hostname/foo.pcap -r s3://pcapbucket/file.pcap</code> will process 2 files.
