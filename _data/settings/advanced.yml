    value: "false"
    text: |
      Enables demo mode which disables most Settings, Users, Cron, and History UI/APIs.
      This is what https://demo.arkime.com uses.
      Demo mode applies to the entire application, and not just a single user.
      We recommend running 1 viewer in demo mode and another in normal mode that only an admin can access to change settings and such.
      You can still have multiple accounts in demo mode if desired.

  - key: disableUserPasswordUI
    value: "true"
    text: |

      When false always show the Change Password form.

    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Semicolon ';' separated list of files to load for config values.
      Files are loaded in order and can replace values set in this file
      or previous files. Setting includes is only supported in the top
      level config file.

  - key: isLocalViewRegExp
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      (Since 1.6.1) If the node matches the supplied regexp, then the node is considered local.

  - key: nodeClass
    value: EMPTY
    text: If a <code>[node]</code> section doesn't have a setting, but has a nodeClass value, the <code>[$nodeClass]</code> section will be checked BEFORE <code>[default]</code>.

  - key: sessionIdTracking
    value: "none"
    text: |
      (Since 5.2) How to track sessions, by default we track based on the source/destination IP and port.
      Arkime can also extend the session id by VLAN or VNI.
      This allows sessions that have the same source/destination IP and port but are on different VLANs or VNIs to be tracked separately.
      It is also possible to treat VLAN and VNI ids as the same with the <a href="#vlan-vni-collapse">[vlan-vni-collapse]</a> section.
      <ul>
      <li>none - Only track based on source/destination IP and port</li>
      <li>vlan - Track based on source/destination IP, port, and vlan</li>
      <li>vni - Track based on source/destination IP, port, and vni</li>
      </ul>

  - key: httpVLanVNI
    value: 0
    text: |
      (Since 5.2) If set to a non-zero value, then this is the vlan or vni that will be used for http connections from capture to OpenSearch/Elasticsearch that we will try and ignore.
