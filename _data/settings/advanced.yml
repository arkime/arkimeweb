      Enables demo mode which disables most Settings, Users, Cron, and History UI/APIs.
      This is what https://demo.arkime.com uses.
      Demo mode applies to the entire application, and not just a single user.
      We recommend running 1 viewer in demo mode and another in normal mode that only an admin can access to change settings and such.
      You can still have multiple accounts in demo mode if desired.
