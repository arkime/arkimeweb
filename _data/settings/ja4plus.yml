  <p>
  Arkime supports JA4, JA4s, JA4x, JA4t, JA4l, and JA4ssh with versions 5.0.0 and later.
  </p>
  <h4>JA4 algorithm</h4>
  <p>
  JA4, the TLS Client Fingerprinting portion, is built into the Arkime capture binary.
  After installing Arkime 5 or later, you will automatically see tls.ja4 field show up.
  We recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/arkime/arkime/releases/tag/last-commit">latest commit builds</a> for now.
  </p>

  <h4>JA4+ algorithms</h4>
  <p>
  JA4+ algorithms have licensing requirements.
  Please <a href="https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4#licensing">familiarize</a> yourself with them before installing/enabling the JA4+ portions of Arkime.
  </p>

  <p>
  To install/enable the JA4+ algorithms you need to:
  <ul>
    <li>download the ja4plus.amd64.so or ja4plus.arm64.so plugin, please download from the SAME location/version as the Arkime you are using</li>
    <li>copy the downloaded plugin to the <code>/opt/arkime/plugins</code> directory on all machines that run capture</li>
    <li>edit the /opt/arkime/etc/config.ini file, modifying the <code>plugins=</code> line so it contains the downloaded filename, for example <code>plugins=ja4plus.amd64.so</code></li>
    <li>restart capture, which will cause the tls.ja4s and cert.ja4x fields to be automatically created for new sessions</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>Other JA4+ algorithms</h4>
  <p>
    Implementing some of the other JA4+ algorithms is on the Arkime todo list.
