    <li>
      We <b>strongly</b> suggest you try tpacketv3 (afpacketv3) first if available BEFORE
      using PF_RING since Arkime supports AFPacket better.
      Note that Arkime only supports vanilla PF_RING and NOT PF_RING DNA nor PF_RING ZC.
      Since our AFPacket support is better than vanilla PF_RING, we recommend you use AFPacket.
      The only time you should use PF_RING with Arkime is when you have other tools on the
      same machine also using vanilla PF_RING, although usually those tools also support AFPacket.
