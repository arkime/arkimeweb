      We suggest you try tpacketv3 (afpacket) first if available on the host.
      Arkime only supports vanilla PF_RING and NOT PF_RING DNA nor PF_RING ZC.
      Simce vanilla PF_RING and afpacket are similar, we recommend you use afpacket,
      since the Arkime support for afpacket in Arkime is much stronger.
      Usually the only time you should use PF_RING is when you have other tools on the
      same machine also using vanilla PF_RING.
      If you want to monitor a large amount of traffic you must set up a PF_RING
      Cluster with multiple virtual interfaces.
