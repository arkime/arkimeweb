      We suggest you try tpacketv3 (afpacket) first if available on the host. 
      Arkime only supports vanilla PF_RING and NOT PF_RING DNA nor PF_RING ZC.
      Simce vanilla PF_RING and afpacket are about the same, we recommend you use afpacket.
      Usually the only time you should use PF_RING is when you have other tools on the 
      same machine also using vanilla PF_RING.

      load the pfring plugin by changing configuration file so it has
