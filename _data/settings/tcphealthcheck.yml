  <p>
    The TCP Health Check plugin enables the capture module to listen on a specific TCP port and immediately close accepted connections.
    This is useful to keep load balancer health checks informed about the capture module working properly.
    One specific use case is
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html">
      Health Checks for Target Groups
    </a>
    in AWS Network Load Balancer.

  <p>
    Add <code>tcphealthcheck.so</code> to the <code>plugins=</code> line in the config file.
  </p>

settings:
  - key: tcpHealthCheckPort
    value: EMPTY
    text: Make the capture module listen on this TCP port for health checks.
