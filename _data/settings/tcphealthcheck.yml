  <p>
    TCP Health Check plugin enables
    the capture module to listen on
    a specific TCP port and immediately
    close accepted connections. This is useful
    to keep load balancer health checks informed
    about the capture module working properly.
    One specific use case is
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html">
      Health Checks for Target Groups
    </a>
    in AWS
    Network Load Balancer.

  <p>
    Add <code>tcphealthcheck.so</code> to the <code>plugins=</code> line in the
    config file.

settings:
  - key: tcpHealthCheckPort
