  <p>
    Arkime can enrich sessions with Suricata alerts.
    Suricata and Arkime must see the same traffic and share the same eve.json/alert.json for the plugin to work.
    Sessions that have been enriched will have several new fields, all starting with suricata, and will be
    displayed in a Suricata section of the standard Arkime session UI.
    Arkime matches sessions based on the 5 tuple from the alert.json or eve.json file, only using the items with event_type of alert.
    A very simple query to find all sessions that have Suricata data is <code>suricata.signature == EXISTS!</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> there isn't a special Suricata UI inside Arkime,
    this is just adding new fields to Arkime sessions like wise or tagger
    do. The Suricata enrichment is done by capture, so
    capture must see the traffic.

  <p>
    Add <code>suricata.so</code> to the <code>plugins=</code> line in the
    config file.

    Sample Config:
  </p>
  <pre><code># Add suricata.so to your plugins line, or add a new plugins line
  plugins=suricata.so

  # suricataAlertFile should be the full path to your alert.json or eve.json file
  suricataAlertFile=/nids/suricata/eve.json</code></pre>

settings:
  - key: suricataAlertFile
    value: REQUIRED
    text: |
      The full path to either the alert.json or eve.json file, make
      sure the <code>dropUser</code> or <code>dropGroup</code> can open the file

  - key: suricataExpireMinutes
    value : 60
    text: |
      (Since 1.5.1) The number of minutes to keep Suricata alerts in memory before expiring them based on the Suricata alert timestamp.
      For example if a Suricata alert has a timestamp of 1am, the default is to keep looking for matching traffic until 2am (60 minutes).
      If reading offline pcap you'll want to increase this number to cover how old the pcap is.
