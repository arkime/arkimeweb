  <p>
    override-ips is a special section that overrides the MaxMind databases
    for the fields set, but fields not set will still use MaxMind (example
    if you set tags but not country it will use MaxMind for the country)
    Spaces and capitalization are very important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 5.0.0 you can now create secondary ini files that will auto reload on changes by setting the <a href="#overrideIpsFiles">overrideIpsFiles</a> setting.
