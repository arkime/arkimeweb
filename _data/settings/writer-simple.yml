  - key: simpleCompression
    value: zstd (>= 5) gzip (4.2 - 5)
    text: |
      (since 4.0.0) The type of compression to use on pcap files. Valid values are: none, gzip, zstd

  - key: simpleCompressionBlockSize
    value: "32000"
    text: |
      (since 4.0.0)
      The block size is how much uncompressed data to attempt to compress into a block.
      The larger the value the better the compression, but the slower the read.
      Recommend using values between 30000 and 120000.

  - key: simpleGzipBlockSize
    value: "0"
    text: |
      (3.3.0 - 3.4.2) This enables GZip on the packet data. The block size is how much uncompressed data to attempt to compress into a block.
      The larger the value the better the compression, but the slower the read.
      Recommend using values between 30000 and 120000.

  - key: simpleGzipLevel
    value: "6"
    text: |
      (since 3.3.0) When GZip is enabled using simpleCompression=gzip, this is the gzip compression level.

  - key: simpleZstdLevel
    value: "6"
    text: |
      (since 4.0.0) When zstd is enabled using simpleCompression=zstd, this is the zstd compression level.

  - key: simpleMaxQ
    value: "2000"
    text: |
      (since 2.0.1) The maximum number of disk queue entries per capture node.
      Once this limit is hit, packets will not be saved to disk until the disk queue falls below the threshold.
      The packets will still be processed, so all meta data is still extracted.
      Sessions that have packets not written to disk will be tagged with pcap-disk-overload.
      Increasing this value will use more memory when there is disk congestion.

  - key: simpleShortHeader
    value: "false"
    text: |
      (since 3.3.0) When TRUE use a non standard pcap file format that uses small packet headers.
      Should only be set when monitoring an interface since it requires that the timestamp is in real time.
      Saves 10 bytes per packet.

  - key: localPcapIndex
    value: "false"
    text: |
      Experimental feature to save the index into PCAPs locally instead of in OpenSearch/Elasticsearch.


  - key: simpleFreeOutputBuffers
    value: "16"
    text: |
      (Since 4.2.0) Max number of disk buffers Arkime keeps around to reduce the number of mmap/munmap.
