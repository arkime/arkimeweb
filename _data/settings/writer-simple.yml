settings:
  - key: simpleEncoding
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Arkime supports <a href="#pcap-at-rest-encryption">PCAP at Rest Encryption</a>.

  - key: simpleKEKId
    value: EMPTY
    text: |
      Which KEK to use, see <a href="#pcap-at-rest-encryption">PCAP at Rest Encryption</a>.

  - key: simpleCompression
    value: zstd (>= 5) gzip (4.2 - 5)
    text: |
      (since 4.0.0) The type of seekable compression to use on PCAP files.
      Zstd (don't use before 4.5.1) has better compression for less CPU than gzip.
      Valid values are: none, gzip, zstd (>= 4.5.1)


  - key: simpleCompressionBlockSize
    value: 32000
    text: |
      (since 4.0.0)
      How many bytes of uncompressed data to attempt to compress at once.
      The larger the value the better the compression, without increasing CPU on capture, but may slow down reads in viewer.
      Recommend using values between 30000 and 120000.

  - key: simpleGzipBlockSize
    value: 0
    text: |
      (3.3.0 - 3.4.2) This enables GZip on the packet data. The block size is how much uncompressed data to attempt to compress into a block.
      The larger the value the better the compression, but the slower the read.
      Recommend using values between 30000 and 120000.

  - key: simpleGzipLevel
    value: 6
    text: |
      (since 3.3.0) When GZip is enabled using simpleCompression=gzip, this is the gzip compression level.

  - key: simpleZstdLevel
    value: 3
    text: |
      (since 4.0.0, > 4.5.1 recommended) When zstd is enabled using simpleCompression=zstd, this is the compression level to use.
      Increasing or decreasing this value will affect the CPU usage of capture, with the default value being a good balance between CPU and compression.
      It is better to increase the <a href="#simpleCompressionBlockSize"><code>simpleCompressionBlockSize</code> setting</a> before increasing simpleZstdLevel.

  - key: simpleMaxQ
    value: 2000
    text: |
      (since 2.0.1) The maximum number of disk queue entries per capture node.
      Once this limit is hit, packets will not be saved to disk until the disk queue falls below the threshold.
      The packets will still be processed, so all metadata is still extracted.
      Sessions that have packets not written to disk will be tagged with pcap-disk-overload.
      Increasing this value will use more memory when there is disk congestion.

  - key: simpleShortHeader
    value: "false"
    text: |
      (since 3.3.0) When <code>true</code> use a non standard PCAP file format that uses small packet headers.
      Should only be set when monitoring an interface since it requires that the timestamp is in real time.
      Saves 10 bytes per packet!

  - key: localPcapIndex
    value: "false"
    text: |
      Experimental feature to save the index into PCAPs locally instead of in OpenSearch/Elasticsearch.


  - key: simpleFreeOutputBuffers
    value: 16
    text: |
      (Since 4.2.0) Max number of disk buffers Arkime keeps around to reduce the number of mmap/munmap.
