name: "Common settings per integration"
before: |
  Every integration can have its own settings with keys, passwords and other things.
  Usually keys and passwords should be set per user in the UI, which will override these.

  These live in each <code>[INTEGRATION-NAME]</code> section

settings:
  - key: disabled
    value: false
    text: If set to true users can NOT use this integration

  - key: cacheTimeout
    value: cont3xt.cacheTimeout
    text: How long to cache results for this integration

  - key: cachePolicy
    value: cont3xt.cachePolicy
    text: Can be <code>shared</code> or <code>user</code>, if set to user then the cache is per user

  - key: viewRoles
    value: EMPTY
    text: (Since 5.0) List of roles that the user must have to use the integration. Use this if some integrations should be limited to certain users.

  - key: userAgent
    value: "[cont3xt].userAgent"
    text: (Since 5.0) The http userAgent to use for any requests this integration makes
